###! Administrative script used to get and manage dovecot on target system according to RiXotStudio's standard
###! CHECKLIST
###! - [X] Bare minimum
###! - [X] SSL
###! - [X] TLS (Handled in postfix)
###! - [ ] Do not allow unencypted traffic
###! - [ ] Disable STARTTLS
###! - [ ] Force SSL/TLS
###! - [ ] Set up virtual users
###!   - https://wiki.dovecot.org/VirtualUsers
###! - [ ] Force usage of OpenPGP encrypted messages
###! - [X] Provide POP3
###! - [ ] Disable IMAP
###!   - [ ] Allow usage on demand
###! - [ ] Reachable only from tor
###! - [ ] Allow address extension i.e user+folder@example.tls would deliver the email in 'folder' instead of an inbox
###! - [ ] Authentication Databases
###! Security concerns:
###! - [ ] It is not acceptable for ISP and 3rd party scanning the network to know that encrypted POP3 is sent from server A to server B
###! SECURITY-CHECKLIST:
###! - [ ] Localhost doesn't have admin privileges (We are using tor so that could make it exposed)
###! Relevants
###! - Research: https://github.com/Kreyren/kreyren/issues/24

# FIXME-SECURITY: Peer-review required
# FIXME-SECURITY: Do not allow localhost to have admin privileges because we are using tor

# FIXME: on devuan we need dovecot-{pop3,imap}d packages
# FIXME: Use official dovecot repo on apt-based? https://repo.dovecot.org
# FIXME: |
# you are using mbox storage
# which is one file with all your mails
# it's slow
# Use maildir
# FIXME: Generate certificates through certbot
# FIXME: Set certificates in /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf
# FIXME: Secure /etc/letsencrypt
# Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbotconfiguration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
